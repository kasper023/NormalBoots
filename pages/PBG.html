                            Austin Hargrave, better known as PeanutButterGamer, 
                            PBG, or occasionally "Peebs", has been making 
                            videos online since early 2009. Fun-loving and 
                            whimsical, he's more interested in making himself 
                            laugh than anything else. If other people are 
                            entertained, it's only by coincidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Originally inspired by older online gaming content 
                            like the Angry Video Game Nerd, he's since found 
                            his own, less angry, more carefree and goofy style.
                            Whether it's a "Review" of a single game, a top 10, 
                            a Hacking video, or anything else, fun is the 
                            number one priority.
